=== EDUCATIONAL GAME SCENARIO: "Digital Realm of Knowledge" ===

Q: What is a variable in Python?
A: A variable is a named reference to a value in memory. Use '=' to assign.

Q: How do loops work?
A: Use 'for' for iteration over sequences; use 'while' for condition-based repetition.

Q: What are functions?
A: Functions group reusable logic. Define with 'def' and return values using 'return'.

Q: What is the difference between a list and a tuple?
A: Lists are mutable (changeable), tuples are immutable (fixed). Choose based on need.

Q: How can I handle errors in Python?
A: Use try/except blocks. For example:
   try:
       x = int("abc")
   except ValueError:
       print("Conversion failed.")

=== SCI-FI GAME SCENARIO: "Beyond the Known" ===

Q: We are nearing the wormhole. Any readings?
A: Sensors detect high curvature; recommend stabilizing the Einstein–Rosen aperture before entry.

Q: Is there intelligent life on this planet?
A: Bio-signatures detected: methane fluctuations and irregular heat maps suggest microbial activity.

Q: Our shields are depleting. What are our options?
A: Divert power from sub-light engines; polarize hull plating; deploy decoy drones.

Q: Can you analyze this alien artifact?
A: The object emits low-frequency electromagnetic pulses — non-terrestrial alloy composition detected.

Q: Tell me about quantum teleportation.
A: Teleportation transfers quantum states, not matter; requires entanglement and classical communication.
