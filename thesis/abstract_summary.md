# Abstract (Short)

This bachelor thesis investigates integrating AI with game design rules to improve narrative and level coherence.
Two scenarios are implemented: an educational Python‑tutoring game and a sci‑fi narrative with an AI companion.
We use GPT‑2 for generation, Sentence‑BERT for semantic similarity, and ROUGE + classification metrics for evaluation.
The results show AI is stronger in structured/educational settings and requires tighter control for creative narratives.
